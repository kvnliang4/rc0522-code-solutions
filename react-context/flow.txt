1. User sign up
  A post request is sent with the username and password provided by the user.
  The password gets hashed and the database gets updated with
  the new user's login details. The hash changes to #sign-in and the user is brought
  back to the sign-in page.

2. User sign in
  A post request is sent with the username and password provided by the user.
  The database checks if the username matches and if it does, the inputed password
  is verified against the hashed password in the database. If that also matches, a token is generated
  and saved to the local storage, and the user is signed in. The hash changes to #.

3. User stays signed in
  The user can stay signed in even if the page is refreshed because of the generated token
  which checks the identity of the user.

4. User can sign out
  The token is deleted from the local storage when the user clicks the sign-out button.
  The hash changes to #sign-in and the user is brought back to the sign in page.
